<p><span class="w3-tag">ESO Science Ambassadors</span></p>
<p>We are astronomy research fellows and PhD students from the <a href="http://eso.org" target="_blank">European Southern Observatory (ESO)</a>, based in offices in Munich Germany and Santiago Chile.
ESO is the foremost intergovernmental astronomy organisation in Europe and the world's most productive astronomical observatory. It is supported by 16 member states across Europe, the host state of Chile and the strategic partner of Australia.
The next major project for ESO is the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) that will contain a 39m main mirror made up of 798 individual hexagon segments! With operations starting in mid 2020s, this will be the largest telescope in the world observing optical and infrared light - it will be the "Biggest Eye on the Sky".</p>

<p>We are all active scientists or engineers and we have started a project to visit science festivals, schools, public observatories and scientific conferences across our member states and Chile.
Our aims are three-fold:<br/> 
(1) Raise awareness of ESO's activities, particulary the ELT, and how each member state is involved;<br/>
(2) Share educational resources with teachers and education centres that have been created by ESO and for the new <a href="https://supernova.eso.org/" target="_blank">ESO Supernova</a><br/>
(3) Promote the <a href="http://eso.org/sci/activities/FeSt-overview.html" target="_blank">scientific opportunities at ESO</a> for early career researchers<br/>
<p>

<p>This website is a portal to find many educational resources and information about ESO. We will also showcase some of the "artist impression" pictures produced by participants in our Exoplanet activities.</p>

<p>
<b>Example past events:</b> Celebrate Science (October 23rd-25th October; Durham, UK); Manchester Science Festival (26th October, UK); 57° congresso nazionale dell'AIF (Sciliy, Italy); Fête de la science (Paris, France); OSSA Toruń (Poland); Sociedad Española de Astronomía 2018 (Salamanca, Spain); Visit to Observatório do Lago Alqueva (Portugal); Soirée étoilée avec Toulx-et-possible (Toulx-Sainte-Croix, France); Ser Cientista (Lison, Portugal)
</p>

In addition, with support from SPIE, we have donated educational kits to education centres across the member states.
